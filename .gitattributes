# Enforce UTF-8 encoding for source files to avoid corrupted accented characters
# Use working-tree-encoding so editors and Git clients normalize files on checkout/commit.

# C# sources and designers
*.cs     text working-tree-encoding=UTF-8
*.designer.cs text working-tree-encoding=UTF-8

# Resource files
*.resx   text working-tree-encoding=UTF-8

# Project and solution files
*.csproj text working-tree-encoding=UTF-8
*.sln    text working-tree-encoding=UTF-8

# PowerShell / scripts / markdown
*.ps1    text working-tree-encoding=UTF-8
*.md     text working-tree-encoding=UTF-8

# Generic: prefer text and normalize line endings for common text files
* text=auto

# Ensure BOM isn't required — editors can use UTF-8 without BOM
# If you want explicit CRLF on Windows, Git core.autocrlf can manage it; we keep text=auto here.
